Here are a few things to get you started on the right path.

## Get the Source Code

In GitHub, you first **fork** a repository when you are going to make changes and submit pull requests.

Then you **clone** a copy to your local development machine (e.g. where you code) to make a copy with all the files to work with.

[Fork mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid/fork) to start contributing to the main project and its documentation, or [search for other repositories](https://github.com/orgs/mermaid-js/repositories).

[Here is a GitHub document that gives an overview of the process.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

## Technical Requirements

[Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). And that is pretty much all you need.

Optionally, to run GUI (Cypress) within Docker you will also need an X11 server installed.
You might already have it installed, so check this by running:

```bash
echo $DISPLAY
```

If the `$DISPLAY` variable is not empty, then an X11 server is running. Otherwise you may need to install one.

## Setup and Launch

### Switch to project

Once you have cloned the repository onto your development machine, change into the `mermaid` project folder (the top level directory of the mermaid project repository)

```bash
cd mermaid
```

### Make `./run` executable

For development using Docker there is a self-documented `run` bash script, which provides convenient aliases for `docker compose` commands.

Ensure `./run` script is executable:

```bash
chmod +x run
```

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**
> To get detailed help simply type `./run` or `./run help`.
>
> It also has short _Development quick start guide_ embedded.

### Install packages

```bash
./run pnpm install  # Install packages
```

### Launch

```bash
./run dev
```

Now you are ready to make your changes! Edit whichever files in `src` as required.

Open <http://localhost:9000> in your browser, after starting the dev server.
There is a list of demos that can be used to see and test your changes.

If you need a specific diagram, you can duplicate the `example.html` file in `/demos/dev` and add your own mermaid code to your copy.

That will be served at <http://localhost:9000/dev/your-file-name.html>.
After making code changes, the dev server will rebuild the mermaid library. You will need to reload the browser page yourself to see the changes. (PRs for auto reload are welcome!)

## Verify Everything is Working

```bash
./run pnpm test
```

The `test` script and others are in the top-level `package.json` file.

All tests should run successfully without any errors or failures. (You might see _lint_ or _formatting_ warnings; those are ok during this step.)

## Last Words

Don't get daunted if it is hard in the beginning. We have a great community with only encouraging words. So, if you get stuck, ask for help and hints in the Slack forum. If you want to show off something good, show it off there.
